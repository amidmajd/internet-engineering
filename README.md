# My Internet Engineering Projects

1. Simple `Socket Programming` server-client application with persian document
2. Limited `HTTP Server` for working with a server in HTTP on a browser which includes :
   * File/Doc requests handling
   * Error handling with a custom ServerError
   * Tokenizer
   * URL management
   * Shorted url and URL mapping support

   next steps would be:
    * making the server multithreaded
    * supporting post requests and a visual mechanism for testing post requests
