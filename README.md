# My Internet Engineering Projects

1. Simple `Socket Programming` server-client application with persian document
2. Limited `HTTP Server` for working with a server in HTTP on a browser which includes :
   * File/Doc requests handling
   * Error handling
   * Buffer management
   * Tokenizer
   * Url management

   next steps would be:
    * making the server multithreaded
    * supporting post requests and a visual mechanism for testing post requests
    * a proper status management mechanism
    * shorted url support
